👋 Hi, I’m Bronson Bradshaw

I’m an electrical engineering student with a passion for building projects that bring together both hardware and software. What I enjoy most about engineering is taking an idea, breaking it into smaller problems, and creating something that actually works in the real world.

🔧 About Me

🎓 Studying Electrical Engineering (in progress)

💡 Interests: digital systems, embedded programming, and circuit design

🖥️ Comfortable with C++, Verilog, and hardware-software integration

🚀 Always excited to learn and take on new challenges

📌 Featured Project: C++ Log Table with Binary Search Tree

One of my recent projects is a C++ application that uses a binary search tree to create and manage a log table. This project taught me how to:

Write clean, reusable C++ code

Apply data structures and algorithms in a practical way

Debug and test to ensure reliable performance

Think about how software solutions connect to hardware systems

🌱 What’s Next

I’m looking forward to applying my skills in an electrical engineering internship, contributing to real projects, and continuing to grow as both an engineer and a programmer.
