👋 Hi, I’m Bronson Bradshaw

I’m an electrical engineering student with an interest in building projects that bring together both hardware and software. What I enjoy most about engineering is taking an idea, turning it into smaller pieces, and making something that is usable in the real world.

📌 Featured Project: C++ Log Table with Binary Search Tree

One of my recent projects is a C++ application that uses a binary search tree to create and manage a log table. This project taught me how to:

Write clean and reusable C++ code

Apply data structures and algorithms in a practical way

Debug and test to ensure reliable performance

Think about how software solutions connect to hardware systems
