👋 Hi, I’m Bronson Bradshaw

I’m an electrical engineering student with an interest in building projects that bring together both hardware and software. What I enjoy most about engineering is taking an idea, turning it into smaller pieces, and making something that is usable in the real world.

📌 Featured Project: C++ Log Table with Binary Search Tree

One of my recent projects is a C++ application that uses a binary search tree to create and manage a log table. This project taught me how to:

Write clean and reusable C++ code

Apply data structures and algorithms in a practical way

Debug and test to ensure reliable performance

🧩 Featured Project: Sudoku Solver  

Another project I worked on is a **C++ Sudoku solver**, where the program can check if a board is solvable using backtracking. This project gave me experience in:  

Applying **recursion** and **backtracking algorithms**  

Working with **2D arrays** and board-based logic  

Improving efficiency by pruning unnecessary steps  

Writing code that balances readability with performance  

This project strengthened my problem-solving skills and showed me how algorithm design can be applied to real-world style problems.

🔢 Featured Project: 8-Bit ALU Calculator  

I designed and implemented an **8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) calculator** using **Verilog** on a **Basys3 FPGA board**. The ALU can perform a variety of operations such as addition, subtraction, bitwise logic, and shifting.  

Through this project, I gained experience in:  

Designing and simulating digital circuits using **Verilog HDL**
  
Working with **combinational logic** and **modular design**
  
Implementing and testing on FPGA hardware (Basys3)
  
Debugging timing and logic errors in a hardware context  

This project strengthened my understanding of digital logic design and gave me practical experience with FPGA-based systems.  

Think about how software solutions connect to hardware systems
